# BallWorldEvolution
BallWorld Evolution is a simple Java application that depicts four bouncing 2D balls. The balls are known as Ball (the red one and also the parent class of all the Balls), GoodBall (the green one), BadBall (the yellow fast one), and UglyBall (the blue slow one) The player may click on the environment the balls are rolling in, and the further the mouse cursor is from the balls while clicking, the slower the balls become. I made this app in March or April 2012 and I used Java.Swing for the graphics, the colors, and the animation. Ball World Evolution (which features four balls, and clicking further from them makes them slower) is not to be confused with Ball World (which features only one ball, and clicking further from it makes it faster).
